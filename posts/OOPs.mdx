## Object-oriented programming

The main aim of OOP is to bind together the data and the functions that operate on them so that no other part of the code can access this data except that function.

There are some basic concepts that act as the building blocks of OOPs i.e.

- [Class](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/object-oriented-programming-in-cpp/#class)
- [Object](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/object-oriented-programming-in-cpp/#object)
- [Encapsulation](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/object-oriented-programming-in-cpp/#encapsulation)
- [Abstraction](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/object-oriented-programming-in-cpp/#abstraction)
- [Polymorphism](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/object-oriented-programming-in-cpp/#polymorphism)
- [Inheritance](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/object-oriented-programming-in-cpp/#inheritance)
- [Dynamic Binding](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/object-oriented-programming-in-cpp/#dynamic-binding)
- [Message Passing](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/object-oriented-programming-in-cpp/#message-passing)

### Class

It is a user-defined data type, which holds its own data members and member functions, which can be accessed and used by creating an instance of that class. A class is like a blueprint for an object.

For Example: Consider the Class of Cars. There may be many cars with different names and brands but all of them will share some common properties like all of them will have 4 wheels, Speed Limit, Mileage range, etc. So here, the Car is the class, and wheels, speed limits, and mileage are their properties.

- A Class is a user-defined data type that has data members and member functions.
- Data members are the data variables and member functions are the functions
  used to manipulate these variables together these data members and
  member functions define the properties and behavior of the objects in a
  Class.
- In the above example of class Car, the data member will be speed limit, mileage, etc and member functions
  can apply brakes, increase speed, etc.

### Object

An Object is an identifiable entity with some characteristics and behavior. An Object is an instance of a Class. When a class is defined, no memory is allocated but when it is instantiated (i.e. an object is created) memory is allocated.

```cpp
// C++ Program to show the syntax/working of Objects as a
// part of Object Oriented PProgramming
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

class person {
    char name[20];
    int id;

public:
    void getdetails() {}
};

int main()
{

    person p1; // p1 is a object
    return 0;
}
```

### Encapsulation

Encapsulation is defined as binding together the data and the functions that manipulate them.

Consider a real-life example of encapsulation, in a company, there are different sections like the accounts section, finance section, sales section, etc. The finance section handles all the financial transactions and keeps records of all the data related to finance. Similarly, the sales section handles all the sales-related activities and keeps records of all the sales. Now there may arise a situation when for some reason an official from the finance section needs all the data about sales in a particular month. In this case, he is not allowed to directly access the data of the sales section. He will first have to contact some other officer in the sales section and then request him to give the particular data. This is what encapsulation is. Here the data of the sales section and the employees that can manipulate them are wrapped under a single name “sales section”.

Encapsulation also leads to _data abstraction or data hiding_.
Using encapsulation also hides the data. In the above example, the data
of any of the sections like sales, finance, or accounts are hidden from
any other section.

### Abstraction

Data abstraction refers to providing only essential information about the data to the outside world, hiding the background details or implementation.

Consider a real-life example of a man driving a car. The man only knows that pressing the accelerator will increase the speed of the car or applying brakes will stop the car but he does not know how on pressing the accelerator the speed is actually increasing, he does not know about the inner mechanism of the car or the implementation of an accelerator, brakes, etc. in the car.

- **_Abstraction using Classes_**: We can implement Abstraction in C++ using classes. The class helps us
  to group data members and member functions using available access
  specifiers. A Class can decide which data member will be visible to the
  outside world and which is not.
- **_Abstraction in Header files_**: One more type of abstraction in C++ can be header files. For example,
  consider the pow() method present in math.h header file. Whenever we
  need to calculate the power of a number, we simply call the function
  pow() present in the math.h header file and pass the numbers as
  arguments without knowing the underlying algorithm according to which
  the function is actually calculating the power of numbers.

### Polymorphism

In simple words, we can define polymorphism as the ability of a message to be displayed in more than one form. A person at the same time can have different characteristics. A man at the same time is a father, a husband, and an employee. So the same person possesses different behavior in different situations. This is called polymorphism. An operation may exhibit different behaviors in different instances. The behavior depends upon the types of data used in the operation. C++ supports operator overloading and function overloading.

- [**_Operator Overloading_**](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/operator-overloading-cpp/): The process of making an operator exhibit different behaviors in different instances is known as operator overloading.
- [**_Function Overloading_**](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/function-overloading-c/): Function overloading is using a single function name to perform
  different types of tasks. Polymorphism is extensively used in
  implementing inheritance.

**Example**:
Suppose we have to write a function to add some integers, sometimes
there are 2 integers, and sometimes there are 3 integers. We can write
the Addition Method with the same name having different parameters, the
concerned method will be called according to parameters.

### Inheritance

The capability of a class to derive properties and characteristics from another class is called [Inheritance](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/inheritance-in-c/).

- **Sub Class**: The class that inherits properties from another class is called Sub class or Derived Class.
- **Super Class**: The class whose properties are inherited by a sub-class is called Base Class or Superclass.
- **Reusability**: Inheritance supports the concept of “reusability”, i.e. when we want to create a new class and there is already a class that includes some of
  the code that we want, we can derive our new class from the existing
  class. By doing this, we are reusing the fields and methods of the
  existing class.

**Example**: Dog, Cat, Cow can be Derived Class of Animal Base Class.

```cpp

// C++ program to demonstrate how to inherit a class
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

// Base class that is to be inherited
class Parent {
public:
    // base class members
    int id_p;
    void printID_p()
    {
        cout << "Base ID: " << id_p << endl;
    }
};

// Sub class or derived publicly inheriting from Base
// Class(Parent)
class Child : public Parent {
public:
    // derived class members
    int id_c;
    void printID_c()
    {
        cout << "Child ID: " << id_c << endl;
    }
};

// main function
int main()
{
    // creating a child class object
    Child obj1;

    // An object of class child has all data members
    // and member functions of class parent
    // so we try accessing the parents method and data from
    // the child class object.
    obj1.id_p = 7;
    obj1.printID_p();

    // finally accessing the child class methods and data
    // too
    obj1.id_c = 91;
    obj1.printID_c();

    return 0;
}
```
