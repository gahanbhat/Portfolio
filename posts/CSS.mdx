Cascading Style Sheets
Used in Front End of [[Full Stack Development]]

- CSS is not a programming language.
- It's not a markup language either.
- CSS is a style sheet language.
- CSS is what you use to selectively style HTML elements.

For ex:
filename : style.css

```
p {
  color: red;
}
```

filename : index.html

```
<link href="styles/style.css" rel="stylesheet" />
```

## Selecting multiple elements

You can also select multiple elements and apply a single ruleset to all of them. Separate multiple selectors by commas. For example:

```
p,
li,
h1 {
  color: red;
}
```

## Centering the image

```
img {
  display: block;
  margin: 0 auto;
}
```

## Fonts

```
html {
  font-size: 10px; /* the base font size is now 10 pixels high */
  font-family: "Open Sans", sans-serif; /* this should be the rest of the output you got from Google Fonts */
}
```

## Styling body

```
body {
  width: 600px;
  margin: 0 auto;
  background-color: #ff9500;
  padding: 0 20px 20px 20px;
  border: 5px solid black;
}

```

# **CSS : All about boxes**

CSS layout is mostly based on the *box model.* Each box taking up space on your page has properties like:

- `padding`, the space around the content. In the example below, it is the space around the paragraph text.
- `border`, the solid line that is just outside the padding.
- `margin`, the space around the outside of the border.
